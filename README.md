# COBIDAS guidelines checklist

The main aim of this project is to improve reporting methods and results
in neuroimaging (f/MRI, i/EEG, MEG, PET...) in order to increase transparency and reproducibility.

We want to do this by developing checklists, based on best practices, guidelines that are both easy and practical to use,
and that provides a computer readable output that can be used to automatically generate parts of the methods section of an article.
