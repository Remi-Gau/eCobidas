 `smoothing_target_space` were smoothed using `smoothing_software` (`smoothing_version`) using a `smoothing_type` (FWHM = `smoothing_size` mm) with a `filtering_approach`.

 example:

 Native volumes were smoothed using SPM (SPM12 - r7487) using a gaussian (FWHM = 8 mm) fixed kernel.

 Template surfaces were smoothed using Freeesurfer (6.0) using a gaussian (FWHM = 8 mm) with iterative smoothing until the desired FWHM was reached.
