I support (f)MRI research across the [Oxford Health Biomedical Research Centre Experimental Medicine theme](https://oxfordhealthbrc.nihr.ac.uk/research/clinical-research-infrastructure-and-experimental-medicine/), where I help researchers design, execute and analyse awesome experimental medicine investigations. I am passionate about bringing inexperienced researchers into the world of programming and Open Research through excellent documentation and accessible resources.
