<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-table:{ .lg .middle } **Spreadsheets**

    ---

    A lot of the work requires to interact with the checklists in their spreadsheet format.

    The MRI part is the more advanced at this moment but we are looking for people to help with the M/EEG part.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Work with our spreadsheets](./spreadsheets.md)

-   :page_with_curl:{ .lg .middle } **Method sections**

    ---

    We want to create boilerplate method sections
    corresponding to a single item or a set of items of the checklist
    to automate methods writing once the checklist is completed.

-   :fontawesome-solid-arrow-pointer:{ .lg .middle } **User interface**

    ---

    The [user interface](https://github.com/ReproNim/schema-ui) is Javascript based
    and uses the [Vue framework](https://vuejs.org/) and this also needs a lot of tweaking,
    so if Javascript is cup of tea: [get in touch!](../contact.md)

-   :material-magnify-expand:{ .lg .middle } **Documentation**

    ---

    If you don't understand something about the project, its goals, its implementation or how to use,
    then it's most likely that we did not do a good enough job at explaining and describing it.
    [Get in touch](../contact.md) and we can work together to improve our documentation.
