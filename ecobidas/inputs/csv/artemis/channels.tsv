Selection of channels for analysis	In this section, you will describe channels selected for statistical analysis and the decision-making process behind it. This is a section about selection of the channels that will be subjected to statistical analysis and their grouping into regions of interest for the purposes of statistical analysis, but not the analysis itself.  NOTE: If you notice a bug, or have a suggestion, we'd be grateful if you posted an issue on GitHub: https://github.com/INCF/artem-is/	Was a subset of channels selected for the purposes of statistical analysis?	This question is about which channels were included in statistical analysis, either as individual channels or averaged/aggregated into regions of interest (ROI). You will be asked about potential channel averaging into ROIs later in this section. How to choose option here: For example, if you conducted an analysis such as cluster-based permutation tests on the entire scalp, you should pick "all channels were submitted to analysis", and not describe permutation tests in this section. If you completed cluster-based permutation tests on a subset of channels, you should select the other option, and then describe how this subset of channels was selected in the follow-up questions.	radio	all channels were submitted to statistical analysis | a subset of channels was submitted to statistical analysis	channels_all_vs_subset	1	1	1	1	Channels	7
Selection of channels for analysis		What was the rationale for selecting this exact subset of channels?	When you are making this decision, you may want to check out papers by Kriegskorte et al.
