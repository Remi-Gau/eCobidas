Preamp peripherals	In this section you will describe hardware choices such as model of amplifier, cap and electrodes used in the study, triggers and additional devices used.  NOTE: If you notice a bug, or have a suggestion, we'd be grateful if you posted an issue on GitHub: https://github.com/INCF/artem-is/	How were the EEG electrodes placed?			radio	cap or net | single electrodes	electrode_placement_type	1	1	1	1	Hardware	3	CapManufacturersModelName	*_eeg.json

Electrode positioning		Which extension of the 10-20 system will you use to describe electrode positions?		We recommend selecting the 5% convention (Oostenveld & Praamstra, 2001) as it is the latest version.	radio	5% convention | 10-10 convention | 10-20 convention	ten-twenty_version	electrode_location_naming_convention == 0	14	1	1	Hardware	3
Electrode positioning		Number of EEG electrodes that were used for acquisition (including, if they are on scalp, ground and reference electrodes, as well as earlobes; excluding EOG and other non-EEG electrodes).		This should not include empty slots on the cap where electrodes were not placed, if there were such slots.	integer		number_EEG_electrodes	1	15	1	1	Hardware	3
Electrode positioning		The appropriate methods description should also include a list or a scheme of all electrode locations. A convenient way to do this is currently not available in ARTEM-IS due to technical limitations, so please provide either a list of all electrodes, or a link where the sceheme/list can be found.		The link can be to a public preregistration document, OSF file, preprint, or a publication. Ideally, the link should not be to an address that you expect to change in the future.	text		link_electrode_scheme	1	16	1	1	Hardware	3					25.08.2023 Angela: Instructions changed - I added the option to list electrodes here in addition to the earlier only option to provide a link to an external location.
Electrode positioning		Were there any electrodes other than scalp electrodes and mastoids/earlobes?		For example: nose electrode or EOG	radio	preset:boolean	non-EEG_electrodes_exists	1	17	1	1	Hardware	3					25.08.2023 Angela: I made the next question optional by adding this question

Triggers		Do you wish to describe triggers in more detail?		This information is not required by the guidelines for good EEG reporting practice by Keil et al. (2014), but it might interest a reader.	radio	preset:boolean	trigger_additional	1	25	1	1	Hardware	3					25.08.2023 Angela: new question to simplify the form by hiding some questions that are not required by any guidelines for good practice, in line with a reviewer's suggestion that it is not neccessary to go this much into detail with triggers  27.11.2023 Angela: corrected to radio and it was radio_multiple by mistake
Triggers		Describe trigger signal input. Were triggers delivered during acquisition (e.g., triggers from photo diode simultaneously recorded while presenting trials) or added after recording (e.g. after analysis of an audio recording of spoken responses)?			radio	Online, during acquisition | Added after recording	trigger_signal_input_when	trigger_additional == 1	26	1	1	Hardware	3	TriggerChannelCount	*_eeg.json			25.08.2023 Angela: visibility changed to make this question practically optional

Other peripheral devices		Was any other equipment used during acquisition?		You can list here any special equipment that you find necessary to report, such as (1) special monitors, keyboards, etc. worth mentioning; (2) additional EEG recording equipment such as AD converters or electrode position measurement devices; (3) other recording equipment used in parallel, such as eye tracking, fMRI, electrodermal or heart rate monitors.	radio	preset:boolean	other_peripheral_devices	1	29	1	1	Hardware	3
