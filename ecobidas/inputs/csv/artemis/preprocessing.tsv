Pre-processing general	In this section, we will ask you about preprocessing decisions, such as analysis software, off-line filtering, re-referencing, artefact removal, epoching and baseline.  NOTE: If you notice a bug, or have a suggestion, we'd be grateful if you posted an issue on GitHub: https://github.com/INCF/artem-is/	Was the same software used for all pre-processing steps?		Preprocessing steps are fitlering, downsampling, re-referencing, artifact removal, epoching and baseline correction, and other up to the point of data collection. If you select YES here, you will be asked to provide the software information now, and if you select NO, you will be asked to specify software when describing each preprocessing step separately.	radio	preset:boolean	same_software	1	1	1	1	Preprocessing	5
