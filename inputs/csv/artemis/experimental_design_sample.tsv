Sample size	In this section you will decrobe the experimental design and sample, such as experimental condition and trial number per condition, number of participants, participant exclusion and presenting software. 	How many subjects participated in the study?		integer		sample_size_total	1	1	1	1	design_and_sample	2		participants.tsv?
Sample size		How many participants, in total, were included in the analysis, after exclusion participants with bad data?		integer		sample_size_valid	1	2	1	1	design_and_sample	2
Sample size		Specify reasons for excluding participants.		textarea		subject_exclusion_rationale	sample_size_total > sample_size_valid	3	1	1	design_and_sample	2
Sample size		How many experimental/comparison (between-subjects) groups did the study feature? 		integer		number_of_groups	1	4	1	1	design_and_sample	2
Sample size		Specify group names separated by semicolon and a space (e.g., test group; control group)		text		order_of_group	number_of_groups > 1	5	1	1	design_and_sample	2
Sample size		How many participants did each group have after exclusion?	Input numeric values in the same order in which groups were listed in the previous section. Values should be separated by semicolon and a space.	text		participants_per_group	1	6	1	1	design_and_sample	2
Presented trials		How many within-subject conditions did the study have?		integer		total_nb_of_within_subject_conditions	1	7	1	1	design_and_sample	2
Presented trials		Specify condition names separated by semicolon and a space (e.g., match; mismatch).		text		within_subject_condition_names	1	8	1	1	design_and_sample	2
Presented trials		What determined the number of trials each subject was presented with?		radio	fixed N of trials delivered | adaptive N of trials (e.g., presenting trials with behavioural errors again until correct response) | Other	trial_presentation_strategy	1	9	1	1	design_and_sample	2
