Measurement	This is a section where amplitude and latency measurement are described.	Did you measure amplitude and/or latency for the purposes of later statistical analysis?		Select no if you did not measure latency or amplitude for the purposes of statistical analysis in the next step. For example, you may have conducted a mass univariate analysis and you did not subject locations and time windows obtained by mass univariate approach to another statistical analysis, or you may have conducted a source analysis.	radio	preset:boolean	measure_intro	1	1	1	1	Measurement	6
