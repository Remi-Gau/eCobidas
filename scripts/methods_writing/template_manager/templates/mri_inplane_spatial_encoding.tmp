This data was acquired using {{NumberShots}} radio-frequency excitations, 
with a phase encoding directon along {{PhaseEncodingDirection}}, with 
an effective echo spacing {{EffectiveEchoSpacing}} seconds and total readout 
time of {{TotalReadoutTime}}, using {{ParallelAcquisitionTechnique}} parallel imaging with a factor of
{{ParallelReductionFactorInPlane}}, a partial Fourrier of {{PartialFourier}}
in the {{PartialFourierDirection}} direction.
