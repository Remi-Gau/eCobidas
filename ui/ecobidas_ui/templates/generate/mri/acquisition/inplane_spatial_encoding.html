This data was acquired using {{NumberShots}} radio-frequency excitations, with a
phase encoding direction along {{PhaseEncodingDirection}}, with an effective
echo spacing {{EffectiveEchoSpacing}} seconds and total readout time of
{{TotalReadoutTime}}, using {{ParallelAcquisitionTechnique}} parallel imaging
with a factor of {{ParallelReductionFactorInPlane}}, a partial Fourrier of
{{PartialFourier}} in the {{PartialFourierDirection}} direction.
