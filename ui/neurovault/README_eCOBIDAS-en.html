    <h1>COBIDAS Information Collection Protocol</h1>
    <p>
      The aim of this protocol is to help users collect information related to
      the different components of the COBIDAS protocol.
    </p>
    <h2>How to use it</h2>
    <p>
      You can navigate each section on the left and then answer the questions
      corresponding to your fMRI analysis. This is meant to make sure that you
      have not forgotten any of the essential information in the methods and
      results parts of your article.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end, you can click on <b>Export</b> (bottom left) to get a zip file
      containing machine readable json files that captures information about
      your method/results section: our next step is to use this to automate the
      part of the methods writing and to submit the information alongside data
      submission to Neurovault and other data archives.
    </p>

    <h2>Why this project?</h2>
    <p>
      Poor methods and results description hinders the reproducibility and the
      replicability of research. It also makes it hard to compare new and old
      results and generally increases inefficiency in the research process. This
      project is built on the hope that improving methods and results reporting
      could improve our research.

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      This checklist is a project to make a user friendly checklist out the best
      practices
      <a href="https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/COBIDASreport">report</a> of
      the Committee on Best Practices in Data Analysis and Sharing (<a
        href="https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/cobidas/"
        >COBIDAS</a
      >) of the
      <a href="https://www.humanbrainmapping.org"
        >Organization for Human Brain Mapping.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      This is very much of a work in progress but the next step is to expand the
      list to cover all the items of the COBIDAS report for fMRI as well as for
      the recent
      <a href="https://osf.io/a8dhx/">extension to EEG and MEG</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>Want to help?</h2>
    <p>
      We are currently working on trying to expand the number of items used in
      the checklist. All of this work is done in google spreadsheets: the
      spreadsheet for each section is accessible by clicking on the
      <b>Source</b>
      at the top of each page.
    </p>

      There is also an [OSF project](https://osf.io/anvqy/) to centralize all
      the information and repos.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have a
      <a href="https://ecobidas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/goals/short-term"
        >list</a
      >
      of short, middle, long term goals: if you are interested by any of those
      get in touch. Many of them do not necessarily require super-advanced
      technical skills (except maybe a certain love for working with spreadsheet
      and wanting them to be super organized).
